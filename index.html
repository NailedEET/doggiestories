      A NEW HOPE FOR DOGS</p>

    <p>If you wish to skip the intro. The skip button is located in the upper left corner, however we do hope you stay.</p>

    <p>For now our story is being created piece by piece, so if by any chance you drop by, this introduction and the website as a whole is being worked on, all text you see is for testing purposes only and will change to the real deal. </p>

    <p>Now, we are not here to change minds or people beliefs , however we will be sharing ups and downs, pros and cons that we experienced by adopting and saving doggies.</p>

    <p>Well "we" is a strong word, the saving was mostly done by my better half, I only tagged along for the ride and gave a hand when I could. </p>

    <p>So I'm gonna try and be as blunt as I can. everything we did so far just got us closer, I used to hate the idea of dogs in the hose, let alone sleep with them. </p>

    <p>Funny enough, I got to that point where I can't imagine what a good night sleep feels like, without 30 something  extra kilograms moving all night, not to mention waking up surrounded by fur, but I wouldn't have it any other way. </p>

    <p> In the end right now all I'm writing here is meaningless, because I do want to remind you, I am just testing the webpage for possible glitches. So I shared a small part of my thoughts.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless I hope we finish it soon, and by the gods it's gonna be awesome. &hellip;</p>

    <p class="center">May the Borks be with you!</p>
  
    <p>Sorry. Couldn't resist it.</p>
  
    <p> See you soon! </p>

    <p>Finally, Han shot first and the original, unadulterated movies remain the best. Stop fiddling with them, George!</p>
